Aligning TEALS APCSA Teaching Resources with the BC Curriculum
--------

This course focuses on object-oriented programming and problem solving in Java. The intended use is for schools offering AP College Board’s Computer Science A course. For schools in BC, Canada, the course can be adapted to align with BC’s grade 12 [Computer Programming](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/12/computer-programming) or [Computer Science](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/mathematics/12/computer-science) courses. Since 2018, our community partner BCIT has been supporting the curriculum alignment work. Here are highlights of the changes:

* added Culture Days
* created alternative unit projects: [Unit 1 Open-Ended Project](Unit1/Lesson-107b.md), [Unit 3 Calculator Project](Unit3/Lesson-318a.md), [Unit 4 Open-Ended Project](Unit4/Lesson-409b.md) and [Unit 5 Open-Ended Project](Unit5/Lesson-506b.md)
* incorprated BC's core competencies: communication, creative and critical thinking, personal and social responsibilities
* added components of BC's learning standards: big ideas, curricular competencies and content

For Computer Programming 12 (Applied Design, Skills and Technologies)
--------
#### Curricular Competencies
* Curricular competencies under Applied Skills, such as  ideating, prototyping and testing, are incorporated into the alternative projects and throughout the course.
* Activities involved conducting user-centred research are added to the course.

#### Content

For Computer Science 12 (Mathematics)
--------
#### Curricular Competencies
* Reasoning and analyzing: Students in various exercises and projects model with mathematics in situational contexts
* Understanding and solving: Students throughout the course represent computer science ideas in concrete, pictorial, and symbolic forms, such as writing psudocode or creating diagrams
* Communicating and representing: Students have opportunities, through various lesson activities, explain and justify computer science ideas. Teaching strategies such as Think-Pair-Share or pair-programming are encourged in the teaching guides 
* Connecting and reflecting: Students have opportunities throughout the course to reflect on mathematical and computational thinking

#### Content
* Unit 3 alternative project [Calculator Project](Unit3/Lesson-318a.md) is added to the course.
