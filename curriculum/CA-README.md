Aligning TEALS APCSA Teaching Resources with the BC Curriculum
--------

This course focuses on object-oriented programming and problem solving in Java and is intended for use by schools offering AP College Board’s Computer Science A course. For schools in BC, Canada, the course can be adapted to align with BC’s grade 12 [Computer Science](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/mathematics/12/computer-science) or [Computer Programming](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/12/computer-programming) courses. Since 2018, our community partner BCIT has been supporting the curriculum alignment work. Here are highlights of the changes:

* created alternative projects for Unit 1-5
* incorprated BC's core competencies: communication, creative and critical thinking, personal and social responsibilities
* added components of BC's learning standards: big ideas, curricular competencies and content
